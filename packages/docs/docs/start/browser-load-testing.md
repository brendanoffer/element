title: Browser Load Testing
---

Browser load testing is a novel approach to load testing which works by simulating user interactions against a website or application, and then scaling that out to hundreds or thousands of browser instances.

Thanks for the economies of scale associated with modern cloud computing platforms, this provides an efficient and scalable way to generate load without worrying about the complexities of network correlation, and over-tuning specific endpoints.

Browser based load testing often produces more accurate real world load simulations than protocol based load testing tools.
